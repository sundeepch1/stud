1. JSONObject:- A JSONObject is an unordered collection of key and value pairs, resembling Java's native Map implementations.
Keys are unique Strings that cannot be null
Values can be anything from a Boolean, Number, String, JSONArray or even a JSONObject.NULL object
A JSONObject can be represented by a String enclosed within curly braces with keys and values separated by a colon, and pairs separated by a comma
It has several constructors with which to construct a JSONObject
It also supports the following main methods:
get(String key) – gets the object associated with the supplied key, throws JSONException if the key is not found
opt(String key)- gets the object associated with the supplied key, null otherwise
put(String key, Object value) – inserts or replaces a key-value pair in current JSONObject.
The put() method is an overloaded method which accepts a key of type String and multiple types for the value.

2. String.valueOf(int)
3. Integer(int).toString()
