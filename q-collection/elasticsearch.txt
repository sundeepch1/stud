1. What is Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is able to achieve fast search response because, instead of searching the text directly, it searchse an index.
it is a search engine based on Lucene. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. It is developed in java and is released as open source under the terms of the Apache License.

2. Why we need elasticsearch?
Implement simle/fuzzy serach
Implement Analytics
Autocomplete and instant search

3. Kibana
Kibana is a window into the Elastic Stack.
It enables visual exploration and real-time analysis of data in elasticsearch

4. Cluster: it is collection of nodes.
5. Node(uuid universaly unique identifier): node is single server that stores all the data and participate in cluster indexing and search capability. it contains Shards and Replica.
6. Shards
7. Replicas
8. Index = database name
9. Document object in json = row in table
10. Type = doc(table name in db)
11. Mapping

12. Elasticsearch API
1) Document API
2) Search API
3) Indices API

5) Cluster API

13. Document API
1) Single Document APIs:- 
a) Index API:- The index API adds and updates a typed JSON document in a specific index, making it searchable
b) Get API, Delete API, Update API
2) Multi Document APIs:- Multi get API, Bulk API, Delete by query API, Update by query API, Reindex API
