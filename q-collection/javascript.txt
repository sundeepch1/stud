JavaScript is complementary to and integrated with Java.
JavaScript is is complementary to and integrated with HTML.

2. What are disadvantages of using JavaScript?
We can not treat JavaScript as a full fledged programming language. It lacks the following important features −
Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.
JavaScript can not be used for Networking applications because there is no such support available.
JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocess capabilities.

3. Object Literals vs 
If you don't have behaviour associated with an object (i.e. if the object is just a container for data/state), I would use an object literal.
var data = {
    foo: 42,
    bar: 43
};
Apply the KISS principle. If you don't need anything beyond a simple container of data, go with a simple literal.

If you want to add behaviour to your object, you can go with a constructor and add methods to the object during construction or give your class a prototype.
